Q. Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime.

Answer:
1) Updating docker compose file
2) We need to first edit the existing docker compose file with the version number of the latest image.
   I did using command line text editor into the application directory and editing the docker compose file
# vi docker-compose.yml

3) Scaling up new container using
# docker-compose up -d --scale web-app=1 --no-recreate
4) Removing old container 
#  docker rm -f old-web-app
5) Scaling down to the single container setup again.
# docker-compose up -d --scale web-app=1 --no-recreate
