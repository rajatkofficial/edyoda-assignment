Observation

1) Using "kubectl apply -f ." command all pod's are created and came into running state
2) Voting app web interface and results web interfaces is accessible through nodeport service & node IP address on 31000 && 31001
3) Voted from three users and voting count is 3.
4) Pod is deleted after the voting, observed that voting application is still accessible since the replica set is defined as 1.
5) As replica set is defined in deployment yaml file. voting app pod instance is launched again with different instance ID. 
   voting pod got created again with instance ID "vote-94325fg78-cskgq"
6) There is no change in application behavior in voting & results windows after worker pod is deleted.
7) Worker new instance got created. Vote count has same value as before worker pod deleted.
8) Similarly, after db pod deleted, vote app & result app pod's are still accessible.
9) When db pod is stopped using command "kubectl scale deploy db --replicas=0". the pod went into terminating state and deleted from node.
10) Now I see votes count became zero in results app window. Even though I tried to vote from voting app the count is not incrementing in results app window.
And I see voting & result pod RESTART count is increased by 1.
12) I have restarted db pod using command "kubectl scale deploy db --replicas=1". Then after some time I see vote count is 2 which is previous count. 
It means when db pod is stopped or terminated, results window does not vote count. After db pod restarted only we can see vote count.
